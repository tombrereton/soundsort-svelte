# Soundsort
Soundsort helps you create your perfect Playlist or Discover Weekly. You select some parameters to generate a playlist
like Genre, Energy, Danceability, Popularity, or BPM and then Soundsort will generate a playlist for you.
Once you are happy with the playlist, you can save it to Spotify. You can also add a schedule to the playlist
so that it updates automatically every week or daily.

Soundsort is built using:
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
